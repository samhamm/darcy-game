<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Mr. Darcy is just a cute dumb dog, but he has a thing for guessing games and numbers. In his little bitty peanut-sized brain, he is thinking of a number. Mr. Darcy likes numbers. And rats. Tasty.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Your task is to guess Mr. Darcy's number.</li>
    <li>You can make a total of three guesses</li>
    <li>After each wrong guess, Mr. Darcy will give you a hint</li>
    <li>If you do not guess his number after three tries, Mr. Darcy will mock you.</li>
    <li>If you guess his number, Mr. Darcy will give you a big wet sloppy doggie kiss.</li>
  </ol>
